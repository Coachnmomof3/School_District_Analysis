# School_District_Analysis.

## Overview of the school district analysis: Explain the purpose of this analysis.

The School board findings of a file showing evidence of academic dishonesty; specifically, reading and math grades for Thomas High School ninth graders appear to have been altered. The School board do not know the extent to the level of dishonesty, they want to uphold state-testing standards. Maria asked me to assist her by replacing the math and reading scores for Thomas High School with NaNs from the rest of the data. I was also tasked with doing the school district analysis and providing a written report.

## Results: Using bulleted lists and images of DataFrames as support, address the following questions.
